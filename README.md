# CS-FInal-Project-
Repository for the Final project of intro to computer science class

this project is the taking of the Game snake game from an outside source :(https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/)
we took this origional code and edited it to make it more easy to read and edit.
we then made four powerups: color change, teleport, multiply leangth and speed increase.
after making the powerups we added them to the origional code with some minor changes to see if it would work.
we were not able to run code because of name error. along with that some of the powerups didnt work and would only show their name or like with the teleport powerup it would end the game
after getting some of the powerups to work and removing the teleport powerup we
debugged the code and did some minor editing.
the code runs but we were only able to get two of the powerups to work, that being speed up and multiply leangth.
